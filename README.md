## What is this?

basically a Create React App starting point with redux, redux-saga and react-router@4.

## Why

I got tired of replicating essentially the same steps needed to incorporate redux into a CRA project.

## How to use

Clone/fork it down, run `yarn` in the project root. Done!

## What about tests?

I just removed the sample test that CRA gives you. Nothing has changed. I should probably throw in some tests for the `rootReducer` and `rootSaga` files at some point.
